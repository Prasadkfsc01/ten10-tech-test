Requirements

## Objective: As a product owner, I want to build a responsive interest calculator web application.

Features:

- The application should provide options to choose the duration for interest calculation: Daily, Monthly, and Yearly.
- Users should be able to input the principal amount.
- Users should be able to select the interest rate from a predefined list of rates up to 15%.
- The application should calculate the correct interest based on the selected duration, principal amount, and interest rate.
- The application should display the calculated interest and the total amount including interest.
- All input fields (principal amount, interest rate, duration and consent) are mandatory.
- The application should inform the user if any field is left empty or not selected.
- For simplicity, the calculated interest and total amount should be rounded to two decimal places.
- The application should be responsive and user-friendly.
- Clear error messages should be displayed to guide users in case of missing or incorrect inputs.

## My understanging

The task was to test an Interest Calculator web application that allows users to:

Enter a principal amount
Select interest rate (up to 15%)
Choose a duration (Daily, Monthly, or Yearly)
Calculate interest and total amount
Validate input fields and user interactions
Ensure responsiveness and user-friendly interface
The goal was to simulate end-to-end user journeys and validate both positive and negative flows using Cypress.

## My Approach

- I setup a robust Cypress framework with TypeScript support.
- Created modular Page Object Model classes for maintainability.
- Integrated Mochawesome reporter for clean HTML reports.
- Covered both functional and UI responsiveness tests.
- Focused on critical user journeys that a real user would follow.
- Added Github actions for it to run nightly every nigth and send notifications on Slack for QA to act

My Test cases

Test Cases Implemented

ðŸ§¾ Login Functionality
âœ… Login with valid credentials
âœ… Login with invalid credentials
âœ… Logout and validate redirection

ðŸ§¾ Registration Functionality
âœ… Register with valid credentials
âœ… (To-do) Show error when registering with already existing credentials

ðŸ§¾ Interest Calculator Functionality [Checks all mandatory fields (principal, rate, duration, consent)]
âœ… Happy Path: Should calculate interest correctly with valid inputs
âœ… Shows alert \`Please fill in all fields.\` when principal amount is less than 1
âœ… Should throw alert message \`Please fill in all fields.\` for missing interest rate field

ðŸ§¾ Responsiveness Tests
âœ… Verified homepage renders correctly on:iPhone X viewport
âœ… Verified homepage renders correctly on:iPad viewport

ðŸ§¾ Homepage Navigation Links
âœ… Click on Ten10TechTest â†’ lands on welcome page
âœ… Home â†’ welcome page
âœ… Privacy â†’ privacy policy
âœ… Register â†’ registration page
âœ… Login â†’ login page

Notes :
? No option to not select interest duration
? Consent check box is not mandatory

Time Constraints [ Could Be Improved with more time]:

- Add negative tests for input field validations (letters in numeric fields, special characters, etc.)
- Add retry logic wrapper for flaky selectors (if needed)
- Validate Mochawesome report integration in CI output
- Expand Slack notification logic for detailed error reporting
